my technical blog in Jekyll

### Notes to myself:
By default, Jekyll uses the syntax highlighter called rouge. However, I couldn't get multiline Python docstring to work with it, so I changed the syntax highlighter to Prism.js by following this tutorial: https://mycyberuniverse.com/web/relpace-rouge-highlighter-prismjs-jekyll.html


## TODO!
1. Why is there no 'same' padding in PyTorch? Look at the comments here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58307036/is-there-really-no-padding-same-option-for-pytorchs-conv2d
2. Why doesn't "+p in vim work in remote machines?
