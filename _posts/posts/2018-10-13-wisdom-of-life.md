* Never stop doing regular **physical exercise**. Otherwise you'll eventually feel as if you're a wet brain carried around by some dangling wooden poles. You'll also stop eating healthy, lose your focussing ability, and become unorganized. In addition, you'll find that getting up from bed in the morning becomes increasingly difficult. On top of it all, you'll lose much of your sexual desire. Remember, a man is born to run in the wilderness hunting for mammoths, while at home he ought to keep himself busy fighting for the attention of his woman of choice.

* When **renting an apartment**, always smell the laundry machine, evaluate whether there's enough lighting, and make sure the taps are working correctly. While signing a contract, read it very carefully and make sure you understand everything in detail, particuarly the points about ending the contract prematurely. It would be best if you could make a contract that would let you move out at any time, provided you're paying a fee totalling up to one or two months rent.

* **Don't rent big and fancy apartments.** You're a bit of an ascetic, and your days are spent in the gym, at work, or in your head in a procrastinative and dreamy state. A small and cheap apartment, which is in a new building (so as to avoid any hassle with something suddenly not working) is best for you.

* **Always keep yourself busy as fuck.** This will prevent procrastination and unnecessary philosophizing, both of which will lead you into a depression-like state.

* In any kind of **business dealings, be precise and definitive, while still being respectful and mindful of the other person**. For example, when you need something done in your rental aparment, you better say "I need this to get done by Friday, or otherwise I'm going to have to end the contract prematurely". You'll find that such a resolve saves you from unnecessary back and forth communication, and from the state of undefinitiveness, which wears on the mind.
